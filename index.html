       <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>
       
       <p>Hello, I'm Aisha Abdirizak, I am 18 years old and graduated high school with my general associates and high school diploma last year (2021). 
            I planned on taking a gap year. Being the first to graduate from my family I was always one to take advantage of opportunities.  
            This lead me to not waste a whole year and enroll in a program named Year Up.  In this program, I am developing software development skills such as coding languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while also learning how corporate America works and sharpening my communication, leadership, and adaptation skills. 
            Year up made me realize the skills that I have obtained individually such as being able to manage my time effectively, being a critical thinker, and sitting back and observing content to pay close attention to detail to be a  creative individual were all I needed in this field which excited me. 
            But as days went on my biggest challenge of all was the most important one communicating with people. I am learning everyday the importance eof communication on how building realtionships and voicing my thinking/questions is what will lead me to success.</p>
       
       <p>My goal is to close the opportunity divide gap for people like myself and be the first in my family to succeed and live the "American dream" while continuing to hone my skills and further my education by getting my bachelor's and becoming a penetration tester in the cybersecurity industry. 
        Year up has taught me In these six weeks the importance of communication and how asking questions, working as a team, and communicating with people was a key aspect in anything really and that although being behind the scenes was my "thing" It showed me how I have to allow myself to grow and use the skills I am learning to help me achieve my goal. </p>
        
       <p>Although I am young and still discovering myself. I do enjoy photography, fashion, reading, and going out and trying new things with my friends and family on my freetime.
        I also come from a family of nine siblings and enjoy playing games with them.</p>
